									Fatto was founded in 2015 as a stricto sensu government relations company, based on the expertise of the partners who founded the company. Over time, the acquired know-how about the functioning of the public sector began to generate value for clients interested in understanding and preparing themselves for the decisions of the government, the National Congress and the Judiciary.<br /><br />

									The “inside” look is in Fatto's DNA. We have leaders in our foundation who have held key positions in the public sector, in addition to employees who have been to important institutions in the country. This helps us formulate scenarios and understand the perspectives of those on the other side of the counter.<br /><br />

									We privilege quality over quantity. We don't believe in information overload to demonstrate work. We believe in constant scores on the scenario that presents itself, but always with a curation of what is really important for customers. As a boutique consultancy, our daily mission is to stay in touch with clients and deliver expert insights on issues that affect each of them in different ways.<br /><br />

									We do this based on qualitative and quantitative data, which crystallizes evidence for our scenarios and strategies. We use our privileged location in Brasília/DF to our advantage.
